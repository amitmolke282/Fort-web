            If youre beginning your journey with Ajanta caves, then you’re bound to find some amazing history of caves. According to Walter M. Spink, the famous history scholar Ajanta Caves were built in two phases (Satavahana Period and Vakataka Period). Unfortunately, the building of caves was halted in midway and was abandoned only to get covered with thick forest. However, in 1819 it was rediscovered by a British officer. Considered as the Buddhist monastery, the caves were excavated between 2nd-century B.C.E and 7th-century C.E.

The natural beauty and peace around the area is the perfect place for meditating. This allowed monks to meditate peacefully. The Buddhist art inside reflects ancient Theravada tradition is having Buddha throne or footprints.

However, of all the 29 caves, cave 1 is the most popular one because every inch of the cave is painted originally. Unfortunately, over the centuries every design has been worn out.
